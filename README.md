## Description ‚úÖ

This is an MVC web application for a factory to manage their engineers, and the machines they are licensed to fix. The factory manager will be able to add a list of engineers, a list of machines, and specify which engineers are licensed to repair which machines. There is a many-to-many relationship between Engineers and Machines. An engineer can be licensed to repair (belong to) many machines (such as the Dreamweaver, the Bubblewrappinator, and the Laughbox) and a machine can have many engineers licensed to repair it.
