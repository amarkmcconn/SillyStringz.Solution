# Dr. Silly Stringz's Factory

## By **Mark McConnell** 👨

### This is an MVC application that will allow a Factory to keep track of engineers and machines

## Technologies Used 🖥️

* _C#_
* _.Net 5.0_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Git_
* _VsCode_

## Description ✅

This is an MVC web application for a factory to manage their engineers, and the machines they are licensed to fix. The factory manager will be able to add a list of engineers, a list of machines, and specify which engineers are licensed to repair which machines. There is a many-to-many relationship between Engineers and Machines. An engineer can be licensed to repair (belong to) many machines (such as the Dreamweaver, the Bubblewrappinator, and the Laughbox) and a machine can have many engineers licensed to repair it.
